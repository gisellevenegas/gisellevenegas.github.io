		<p>My name is Giselle Joanna Amaral Venegas. I am 15 years old and my birthday is on February 18. My favorite thing to eat is chocolate because I LOVE chocolate. Not only that but, I love to go on Netflix and watch my favorite show, Grey's anatomy.<br> </p>
<br>
			I was born in Oakland, California. My mom is from Oakland too and my dad is from Sinaloa. A fun fuct of mine is that I 
			recently held a brain and I used to know how to do the splits. If I could have three wishes I would ask for happiness, success, and money.
